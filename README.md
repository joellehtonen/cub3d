WHAT IS THIS?

This is the 2nd game project made in Hive, this time in 3D using raytracing, in the style of Wolfenstein and Doom. 

WHAT I DID?

This was a team project, our wonderful team consisting of ethan-berkowitz and me. I was responsible for the raytracing part of the code and rendering the textures correctly onto surfaces. 

The project was also used parts of my earlier Hive game project, So Long, as its early foundation when it came to player movement and controls. 

WHAT I LEARNED?

As I used trigonometrics to calculate the ray trajectories, I became familiar with more complex math than I was previously used to. Debugging the rays was also fairly complex process that developed my logical thinking even further. 

I think this was the first project where we were concerned about perfomance, and a lot of the coding choices were made with efficiency and framerate in mind. Making the 1st person animation look right, consists of surprisingly many elements and movements on different axises. 

WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY?
I would probably try to use another, perhaps more efficient or simpler way of calculating ray trajectories, as that was the biggest hurdle of this project. 

I am not also happy how I developed the door opening mechanism, it was fairly straightforward and simple solution made at the end of the project. Something more elegant would have taken more time than we had left.

Although I am very happy with our minimap, it would be nice if it would be centered on the player at all times. 

Some other students made enemies and weapons to their game, and even though I was always happy with the approach we took, it would be nice challenge to incorporate those as well. 

WHAT ELSE?
Honestly, I am pretty happy with how this turned out. I would like one day to come back to this project and develop it a bit further (although I probably won't). 

I made a bonus mode to the game, where the light is slowly dwindling, and it could be fairly easily expanded it a mode where the player has to look for keys, and lighter fluid with the labyrinthian levels, to escape before the light goes completely out.
